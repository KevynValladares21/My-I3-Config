This is my i3 configuration. 

It was designed with a minimalist look inspired by the catppuccin mocha mauve theme and uses the same colorscheme.

It uses i3status because it strikes a good balance between using minimal resources and looking clean.

It should work out of the box with i3, no extra software needed. I use this configuration on EndeavourOS Linux which is an Arch-based distro.
